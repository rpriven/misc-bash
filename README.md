# misc-bash

This is a collection of miscellaneous bash scripts that I didn't think needed their own repository so I put them together in here.

Some of these are useful and some are pretty old or not very useful.

## Updates

- quick_recon.sh is in the process of being integrated into a new suite that I'm currently testing
- bugbountytools.sh has been worked into [toolbelt](https://github.com/rpriven/toolbelt)

## Highlights

Script | Description
--- | ---
jre_switcher.sh | switches jre to 17 (burpsuite) or 11 (neo4j/bloodhound)
quick_recon.sh | automation for scanning
bugbountytools.sh | see [toolbelt](https://github.com/rpriven/toolbelt)
bin_flag.sh | pulls flags from binary files
crackmapauto.sh | needs work but could prove useful
juice_shop.sh | sets up juice shop for you using docker
defense1.sh | helpful for setting up IDS with snort

Please let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions.
